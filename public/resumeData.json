    "bio": "Hi there! I am Faisal Abdul Rasheed!. I've been in the Architecture Industry for over 10 years now. As a Full time Devoloper or a Designer I've worked both with startups and large corporations to help build & scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in helping others excel and pursue their dreams. With this passion, I have now constructed and designed so many Houses and Schools and etc.. across the globe. Through live coaching sessions on Youtube, I have accumulated several thousand's views demonstrating how to apply developer skills in a range of cool builds and challenges. I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching REAL WORLD projects and Softwares to help students enter the world of Architect, Engennering and Designing. Youâ€™ll get hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to succeed in the real-world in this community.",
